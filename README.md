# Smart LED Lamp PCB

## Description
A DIY project to create a professional-looking smart LED lamp using EasyEDA for PCB design and JLCPCB for fabrication. This project demonstrates how to design, fabricate, and assemble a circular LED lamp with a D1 Mini microcontroller and WS2812B RGB LEDs. Perfect for IoT enthusiasts, makers, and those interested in PCB design. ðŸš€

## Features
- **Professional PCB Design**: Clean and compact design for a circular LED layout.
- **Customizable Lighting**: Individual RGB LED control using WS2812B.
- **IoT Ready**: Integrate with WLED for smart home scenarios.
- **Power Options**: USB-C power supply with optional battery integration.
- **Scalable**: Easily replicate the design for larger-scale projects.

## Components
- D1 Mini Microcontroller
- WS2812B RGB LEDs (up to 25 LEDs)
- USB-C Port for Power Input
- Capacitors and Resistors for Signal and Power Stability

## Tools Used
- **EasyEDA**: For schematic design and PCB layout.
- **JLCPCB**: For PCB fabrication and assembly.
- **WLED Software**: To program and control the LED lamp.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnisZiadi/SmartLED-Lamp-PCB.git
   ```
2. Open the `.json` files in EasyEDA to review the schematic and PCB layout.
3. Modify the design or use it as is.
4. Export the Gerber files and BOM for fabrication at JLCPCB or a similar service.
5. Assemble the components and program the D1 Mini with WLED.
6. Enjoy your custom smart LED lamp! ðŸ’¡

## Project Files
- **Schematic**: The circuit diagram for the project.
- **PCB Layout**: The design of the printed circuit board.
- **Gerber Files**: For PCB fabrication.
- **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: A list of all components.
